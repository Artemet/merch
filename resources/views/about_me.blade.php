    <h3>My life</h3>
    <p>Hello, I'm Artyom! I am 16 years old.
        I am very glad that I decided to create a channel
        drive_life_car. To be honest, when I created the channel
        I thought that I created it in vain. I have seen very
        many channels with very high quality content,
        but they had very few subscribers.
        I consider myself very lucky.
        Subscribers accumulate, but people do not forget me.</p>
    <p>Moreover, I myself was able to rise, so I also
        helped friends! For example, the drive_life_moto channel
        We got 1000 subscribers in a week
        and no less likes, but he is, to my great regret
        abandoned his channel and when he decided to return,
        it was already very late. People have forgotten him
        subscribers and likes were not recruited. After
        this case, I realized how important
        keep the channel and don't drop it!</p>
