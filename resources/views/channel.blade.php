    <h3>Channel of drive_life_car</h3>
    <p>The drive_life_car channel was created in 2020.
        During this time I posted a lot of videos on
        your channel, tried. When creating a channel
        I set myself the goal of gaining a lot of subscribers,
        and be popular.
        Basically, I shoot various jokes, memes
        and test drives with cars. Apart from this, more
        and computer content!</p>
    <p>I am currently writing this text during
        creating this site, and I donâ€™t know what wakes up
        while I finish this site,
        what happens to the channel? I am planning
        distribute the drive_life_car channel
        apsalyutno in all hundreds of networks!
        I hope I succeed.</p>
